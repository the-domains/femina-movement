Wild women, Soul Sisters, Tribe, Collaborates, Community.

Join the amazing, supportive women who live, breathe and inspire the F.E.M.I.N.A. Movement principles!

When we come together in equality and acceptance, holding sacred space and making connection, we allow magic to take place. When we are seen, heard, and held we can transform out of insecurity and pain, and claim our true radiance and power.

To participate in a sister circle is nourishing to the natural yearning for authentic connection and creates an opportunity for deep friendships.

Join us for [monthly Sister Circle][0] - we meet on the evening of each New Moon - we'd love to have you.

> "A circle of women may be the most powerful force known to humanity. If you have one, embrace it. If you need one, seek it. If you find one, for the love of all that is good and holy, dive in. Hold on. Love it up. Get naked. Let them see you. Let them hold you. Let your reluctant tears fall. Let yourself rise fierce and love gentle. You will be changed. The very fabric of your being will be altered." - Jeanette LeBlanc
