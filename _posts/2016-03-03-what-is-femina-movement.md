# What is FEMINA Movement?

_It is about Feeling, Empowering, Inspiring, Nourishing, and Aligning our Mind, Body and Spirits._

_It is about how our individual attitudes and actions towards ourselves and one another can lead to either self-love, or continued self-consciousness -- it's our choice!_

__

_It is about "perfection" and the "ideal body/diet/life" that society has apparently decided for us._

_It is about how we are expected to behave and look as women, and what we can do to break free._

_It is about the pain we experience and the pain we inflict upon ourselves and one another. (Hey: Choose HAPPINESS!)_

_But even more, FEMINA Movement is about happiness; it's about love. It's about loving ourselves. It's about loving one another. It's about being freakin' HAPPY in this lifetime! _

The F.E.M.I.N.A. guidelines mean that instead of focusing so much of our time and energy on what we have/don't have, how we look/don't look, and what we do/don't do, we need to focus on how we want to feel in our lives, empower ourselves to lead the best lives for us (and not somebody else's idea of the best life!). We need to move our bodies and appreciate the movement of our bodies (awkward, clumsy, or graceful - just appreciate the ability to move!), inspire one another to make positive changes and love ourselves, nourish our bodies with natural, healthy foods, and align our Mind, Body and Spirit to live fully and balanced.  

## MISSION:

The FEMINA Movement is about exploring the connection between our Mind, Body and Spirit for the development of our health, happiness, and acceptance in our own bodies and in our relationships with those around us.

**The FEMINA Movement is a self-appreciation movement for women of all ages, sizes, backgrounds, etc.**

Why the name FEMINA? Well, when I was 18, I got my first tattoo. I was in the midst of dealing with my anorexia and I needed a mantra of sorts to see every day to remind myself that I could get through this. So, I had "Femina" tattooed in script on my wrist. 

Femina means "woman" in Latin and I fell in love with it. To me, it appeared soft and pretty on the outside, but represented female strength and empowerment on the inside. And what better word to represent ourselves - strong, healthy, happy women - than that?

I believe that if we all share our stories, ideas, challenges and successes about our body love, life and everything in between, we will discover that we are more than our shape and size. We are more than what society tells us to be. We will discover that our bodies are under our control -- not somebody else's -- and we will learn to truly appreciate our vessels, unconditionally. **We can each learn to love our own body because it has been with us every second of our lives and will be for every second we have left. It has been, and will be, there for everything. It is time to feel, empower, move, inspire, nourish and align ourselves; to give back to our bodies instead of hurting them with thoughts, words, and actions that are damaging.**

Maybe you've already started this, or have been doing this all along. Or maybe this seems like an impossible beginning for you. But just start. **Start somewhere, start anywhere. _Just start._** Feel your way. You will not only begin healing yourself, but you will begin healing others as well - or prevent others from feeling this way altogether (such as your daughter, your niece, your granddaughter, your students, the young girl next door, etc.)

**The FEMINA Movement is here for you.**

Take the time to free yourself. Read the stories and blog posts, connect with others, laugh, cry, feel every emotion imaginable. The FEMINA Movement also requires action. I welcome you to join in my group classes at [Body Solace Yoga Studio][0] where you're invited to love your body, sweat, connect, and have a great time. If you want to take it even deeper, you can sign up for one-on-one sessions with me to develop yourself physically, relax, or whatever else you're craving at that time. And be sure to check out our events, workshops and programs for something that may interest you. (You never know where you'll find yourself or what you'll discover!) 

_You don't need their approval,_

_As even in your despair, you are magnificent._

_Be willing to bite; be insatiable._

_Seek to be more of yourself,_

_Feel free, feel tribal, feel joy._

_You are absolutely glorious._

Thank you for being here, and remember to thank yourself for being here. Be proud -- you just made the first step.
